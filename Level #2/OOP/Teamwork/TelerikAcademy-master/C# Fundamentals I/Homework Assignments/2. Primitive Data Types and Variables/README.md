##Primitive Data Types and Variables

1. Declare five variables choosing for each of them the most appropriate of the types <code>byte</code>, <code>sbyte</code>, <code>short</code>, <code>ushort</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>uint</code>, <code>long</code>, <code>ulong</code>, so that they can be initialized with the following values: 52130, -115, 4825932, 97, -10000.
* Which of the following values can be assigned to a variable of type <code>float</code> and which to a variable of type <code>double</code>: 34.567839023, 12.345, 8923.1234857, 3456.091?
* Write a program which safely compares floating-point numbers with precision of 0.000001. Example: (5.3 ; 6.01) -> false; (5.00000001 ; 5.00000003) -> true.
* Declare an integer variable and initialize it with the hexadecimal representation of the decimal number 254. You can use Windows Calculator (Programmer View) to convert numbers between different bases.
* Declare a character variable and initialize it with the character that has Unicode code of 72. Hint: First use Windows Calculator to find the hexadecimal representation of 72.
* Declare a boolean variable called <code>isFemale</code> and initialize it with an appropriate value corresponding to your gender.
* Declare two <code>string</code> variables and initialize them with "Hello" and "World". Declare an <code>object</code> variable and initialize it with the concatenation of the first two variables (don't miss the space). Declare a third <code>string</code> variable and initialize it with the value of the <code>object</code> variable (do a type cast).
* Declare two <code>string</code> variables and initialize them with following value:

    > The "use" of quotations causes difficulties.

    Do it with and without using quoted strings.
* Write a program which prints an isosceles triangle made up of 9 copyright characters <code>©</code>. Use Windows Character Map to find the Unicode code of the <code>©</code> character. Note: The <code>©</code> character may not be displayed correctly.
* A marketing company needs to keep a record of its employees. Each record should have the following characteristics – first name, family name, age, gender (m or f), ID number, unique employee number (27560000 to 27569999). Declare the variables necessary to keep the information for a single employee using appropriate data types and descriptive names.
* Declare two integer variables and initialize them with the numbers 5 and 10, then exchange their values.
* Find some online information about ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) and write a program which prints the entire ASCII table of characters to the console.
* Create a program that assigns <code>null</code> values to an integer and a double variable. Try to print them to the console, try to add some values or the <code>null</code> literal to them and see the result.
* A bank account has a holder name (first name, middle name and last name), available amount of money (balance), bank name, IBAN, BIC code and 3 credit card numbers associated with it. Declare the variables necessary to keep the information for a single bank account using the appropriate data types and descriptive names.
