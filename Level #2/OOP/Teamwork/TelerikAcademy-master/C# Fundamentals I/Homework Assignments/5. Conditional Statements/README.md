##Conditional Statements

1. Write an `if` statement which compares two integer variables and exchanges their values if the first one is greater than the second.
* Write a program which shows the sign (+ or -) of the product of three real numbers without calculating it. Use a sequence of `if` statements.
* Write a program which finds the greatest of three integers using nested `if` statements.
* Sort 3 real values in descending order using nested `if` statements.
* Write a program which reads a digit from the console and then shows the name of that digit. Use a `switch` statement.
* Write a program which reads the coefficients *a*, *b* and *c* of a quadratic equation *ax<sup>2</sup>+bx+c=0* and calculates and prints its roots. Note that quadratic equations can have 0, 1 or 2 real roots.
* Write a program which finds the greatest of 5 given numbers.
* Write a program which, depending on the user's choice, reads an `int`, a `double` or a `string` variable. If the variable is an integer or a double, add 1 to its value. If the variable is a `string`, append an asterisk (`*`) to it. The program must show the value of the variable as a console output. Use a `switch` statement.
* We are given 5 integers. Write a program which checks if they have a non-empty subset that sums to 0. Example: 3, -2, 1, 1, 8 -> 1+1-2=0.
* Write a program that applies a bonus to a given score in the range [1..9]. The program reads a digit as an input.
    * If the digit is between 1 and 3, multiply it by 10;
    * If it is between 4 and 6, multiply it by 100;
    * If it is between 7 and 9, multiply it by 1000;
    * If it is zero or if the value is not a digit, the program must report an error.
    Use a `switch` statement and write the new bonus value to the console.
* \*Write a program which converts a number to its text representation. Examples:
    * 0 -> "Zero"
    * 273 -> "Two hundred seventy-three"
    * 400 -> "Four hundred"
    * 501 -> "Five hundred and one"
    * 711 -> "Seven hundred and eleven"
