##Operators and Expressions

1. Write an expression which checks if a given integer is odd or even.
* Write a boolean expression which checks if a given integer can be divided (without remainder) by both 7 and 5.
* Write an expression which calculates a rectangle's area by given <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>.
* Write an expression which checks if the third digit (right-to-left) of a given integer is 7. Example: 1732 -> true.
* Write a boolean expression which finds if bit 3 (counting from 0) of a given integer is 1 or 0.
* Write an expression which checks if a given point (<code>x</code>, <code>y</code>) is within a circle K(C(0, 0), R=5).
* Write an expression which checks if a given positive integer <code>n</code> (n â‰¤ 100) is prime. Example: 37 is prime.
* Write an expression which calculates a trapezoid's area by given sides <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> and height <code>h</code>.
* Write an expression which checks if a given point (<code>x</code>, <code>y</code>) is within the circle K(C(1,1), R=3) and out of the rectangle R(top=1, left=-1, width=6, height=2).
* Write a boolean expression which returns if the bit at position <code>p</code> (counting from 0) in a given integer <code>v</code> has a value of 1. Example: v=5; p=1 -> false.
* Write an expression which extracts from a given integer <code>i</code> the bit at position <code>b</code>. Example: i=5; b=2 -> value=1.
* We are given an integer <code>n</code>, value <code>v</code> (<code>v</code>=0 or 1) and a position index <code>p</code>. Write a sequence of operators which modifies <code>n</code> so that it holds the value <code>v</code> at position <code>p</code> in its binary representation. Example:

        n = 5 (00000101), p=3, v=1 -> 13 (00001101)
        n = 5 (00000101), p=2, v=0 ->  1 (00000001)
* Write a program that exchanges bits 3, 4 and 5 with bits 24, 25 and 26 in a given 32-bit unsigned integer.
* \*Write a program that exchanges bits {p, p+1, ..., p+k-1) with bits {q, q+1, ..., q+k-1} in a given 32-bit unsigned integer.
