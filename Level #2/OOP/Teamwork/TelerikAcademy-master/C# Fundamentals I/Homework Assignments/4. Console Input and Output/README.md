##Console Input and Output

1. Write a program which reads 3 integers from the console and prints their sum.
* Write a program which reads the radius <code>r</code> of a circle and prints its perimeter and area.
* A company has name, address, phone number, fax number, web site and manager. The manager has first name, last name, age and a phone number. Write a program which reads the information about a company and its manager and prints it to the console.
* Write a program which reads two positive integers and prints the count of the integers *p* between them (the bounds included) which are divisible by 5. Example: *p(17,25) = 2*.
* Write a program which reads two numbers from the console and prints the greater of them. Donâ€™t use <code>if</code> statements.
* Write a program which reads the coefficients *a*, *b* and *c* of a quadratic equation *ax<sup>2</sup>+bx+c=0* and solves it.
* Write a program which reads an integer <code>n</code>, then reads <code>n</code> more numbers and calculates and prints their sum.
* Write a program which reads an integer <code>n</code> from the console and prints all the integers in the range *[1...n]*, each on a separate line.
* Write a program which prints to the console the first 100 elements of the Fibonacci sequence: *0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, ...*
* Write a program which calculates the sum (with error of 0.001) of the *alternating harmonic series*: *1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + 1/5 - ...*
* \*Implement the "Falling Rocks" game as a console application. A spaceship stays at the bottom of the screen and moves left or right (use the arrows keys). Rocks (asteroids) of different sizes and shapes constantly fall down and the spaceship has to avoid them. The rocks contain the following characters: *^*, *@*, ***, *&*, *+*, *%*, *$*, *#*, *!*, *.*, *;*, distributed with appropriate density. The string <code>(O)</code> is used to represent the spaceship. Ensure a constant game speed by <code>Thread.Sleep(150)</code>. Implement collision detection and a scoring system.
