## Numeral Systems

1. Write a program which converts a decimal number to its binary representation.
* Write a program which converts a binary number to its decimal representation.
* Write a program which converts a decimal number to its hexadecimal representation.
* Write a program which converts a hexadecimal number to its decimal representation.
* Write a program which converts a hexadecimal number to its binary representation (directly).
* Write a program which converts a binary number to its hexadecimal representation (directly).
* Write a program which converts a number from base `s` to its representation in base `d` (2 ≤ `s`, `d` ≤  16).
* Write a program that shows the binary representation of a given 16-bit signed integer (the C# type `short`).
* \* Write a program that shows the internal binary representation of a given 32-bit signed single-precision floating-point number in IEEE 754 format (the C# type `float`). Example: -27,25 -> sign = 1, exponent = 10000011, mantissa = 10110100000000000000000.
