## Arrays

1. Write a program which allocates an array of *20* integers and initializes each element by its index multiplied by *5*. Print the array to the console.
* Write a program which reads two arrays from the console and compares them element by element in order to check if they are identical.
* Write a program which compares two character arrays lexicographically (letter by letter).
* Write a program which finds the longest contiguous subsequence of equal elements in an array. Example: {2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, `2, 2, 2`, 1} -> {2, 2, 2}.
* Write a program which finds the longest increasing contiguous subsequence in an array. Example: {3, `2, 3, 4`, 2, 2, 4} -> {2, 3, 4}.
* Write a program which reads two integers `N` and `K` and an array of N elements from the console. Find those K consecutive elements which have a maximum sum.
* Sorting an array means to arrange its elements in ascending/descending order. Write a program which sorts an array. Use the *selection sort* algorithm: find the least element, put it at position 0, find the least element from the rest, put it at position 1, etc.
* Write a program which finds the contiguous subsequence having maximum sum in a given array. Example: {2, 3, -6, -1, `2, -1, 6, 4`, -8, 8} -> {2, -1, 6, 4}. Can you do it with one loop only (a single scan through the elements of the array)?
* Write a program which finds the most frequently occurring element in an array. Example: {`4`, 1, 1, `4`, 2, 3, `4`, `4`, 1, 2, `4`, 9, 3} -> 4 (5 times).
* Write a program which, given an array of integers and another integer `S`, finds in the array a contiguous subsequence that sums to `S` (if such exists). Example: {4, 3, 1, `4, 2, 5`, 8}, S=11 -> {4, 2, 5}.
* Write a program which finds the index of a given element in a sorted array of integers using *binary search*.
* Write a program which creates an array containing all the letters in the alphabet (A-Z). Read a word from the console and print the index of each of its letters.
* \*Write a program which sorts an array of integers using the *merge sort* algorithm.
* Write a program which sorts an array of strings using the *quick sort* algorithm.
* Write a program which finds all primes in the range [1...10 000 000]. Use the *sieve of Eratosthenes*.
* \* You are given an array of integers and another integer `S`. Write a program which finds if there exists a subset of the elements that sum to `S`. Example: {2, 1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 2, 6}, S=14 -> yes (1+2+5+6).
* \* Write a program which reads three integer numbers `N`, `K` and `S` and an array of N elements from the console. Find a subset of K elements that sum to S or indicate that such does not exist.
* \* Write a program which reads an array of integers and removes from it a minimum number of elements so that the remaining array is sorted in ascending order. Print the sorted array. Example: {6, `1`, 4, `3`, 0, `3`, 6, `4`, `5`} -> {1, 3, 3, 4, 5}.
* \* Write a program which reads a number `N` and generates and prints all the *permutations* of the numbers [1...N]. Example: n = 3 -> {1, 2, 3}, {1, 3, 2}, {2, 1, 3}, {2, 3, 1}, {3, 1, 2}, {3, 2, 1}.
* Write a program which reads two numbers `N` and `K` and generates all the *variations* of K elements from the set {1...N}. Example: N = 3, K = 2 -> {1, 1}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 1}, {2, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 1}, {3, 2}, {3, 3}.
* Write a program which reads two numbers `N` and `K` and generates all the *combinations* of K distinct elements from the set {1...N}. Example: N = 5, K = 2 -> {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {1, 5}, {2, 3}, {2, 4}, {2, 5}, {3, 4}, {3, 5}, {4, 5}.
