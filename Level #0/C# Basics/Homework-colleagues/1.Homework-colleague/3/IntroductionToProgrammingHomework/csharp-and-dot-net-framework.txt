	C# is a programming language, .NET is the framework that the language is built on.In .NET you 
don't find only C#. You can find Visual Basic for example. 
	C# is a programming language, .NET is a blanket term that tends to cover both the .NET Framework
(an application framework library) and the Common Language Runtime which is the runtime in which 
.NET assemblies are run.
	Microsoft's implementation of C# is heavily integrated with the .NET Framework so it is
understandable that the two concepts would be confused. However it is important to understand
that they are two very different things.
	.NET isn't just a library, but also a runtime for executing applications.
The knowledge of C# implies some knowledge of .NET (because the C# object model
corresponds to the .NET object model and you can do anything interesting in C#
just by using .NET libraries). The opposite isn't necessarily true as you can
use other languages to write .NET applications.
