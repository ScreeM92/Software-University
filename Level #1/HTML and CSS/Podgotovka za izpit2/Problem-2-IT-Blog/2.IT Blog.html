                <h3>Write Code Every Day</h3>
                <p>Last fall, work on my coding side projects came to a head:
                    I wasn’t making adequate progress and I couldn’t find a way
                    to get more done without sacrificing my ability to do effective
                    work at Khan Academy. There were a few major problems with how

                <h3>Node.js Stream Playground</h3>
                <p>This summer I had the opportunity to attend NodeConf and it was a fantastic experience.
